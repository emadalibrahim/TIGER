# Transport decarbonization (TIGER) 

This repository contains the code and data supporting the study “A Cost-Benefit Analysis of Transport Decarbonization in Taiwan”, conducted as part of Taiwan’s Innovative Green Economy Roadmap (TIGER) at MIT.

The repository provides tools for reproducing results and conducting further analysis, including:

- Life Cycle Assessment (LCA): Estimation of total greenhouse gas emissions across vehicle segments.
- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO): Comparison of capital, fuel, and maintenance/repair costs across vehicle types.
- CO₂ Abatement Costs: Calculation of the cost per ton of CO₂ avoided under different technologies and scenarios.
- Projections of emissions, energy demand, and charging infrastructure requirements.
